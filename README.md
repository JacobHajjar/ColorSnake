# ColorSnake

ColorSnake is my version of the classic snake game played on a grid. In this version, players will have the option to select from 3 different difficulties, with each speeding up the rate at which the snake moves in the world and that food will spawn. Similar to classic snake, food that spawns in the grid will increase the snake's size. The snake can be controlled with the arrow keys on the keyboard and consumes the food upon contact. In addition to these classic snake rules, in color snake, the color changes each time food is eaten, adding a modifier increasing the player's points with each color changed. When the game is finished, a leaderboard is displayed which shows the highest scored saved to the user's local storage.
